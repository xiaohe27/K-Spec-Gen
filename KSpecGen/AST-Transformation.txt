1. The == comparasion operator is overloaded in java.
When its operands are strings, the semantics is testing whether 
the lhs and rhs refer to the same string obj in the memory, NOT comparing the
contents.

Therefore, it shouldn't be naively transformed to ==String in k-spec, where the 
operator ==String compares whether the string contents are equal.

To fully achieve the semantics equivalence is possible but quite complicated,
considering that it is not frequently used and the implementation time is limited,
we decide to leave this as future work.
