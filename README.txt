This is a project for generating k specification from annotated java program.
The k specification is an input for k-verifier[1] which can do program verification.

This software aims to be a service for programmers who want to do program verification
using k framewrok[2], and therefore we've tried our best to present the service in a
user-friendly way. We have provided an online interface (with syntax highlighting)
for using the service in addition to the traditional command-line interface.

Web-interface:
1. Go to url http://k-spec-generator.herokuapp.com/
2. Either select a running example from the left-hand side pop-up menu,
   or directly paste the annotated java program into the central textbox. 

Command-line interface:


The project can be located in the github page:
