1. Test the function which converts a java expr (denoting the pre/post conditions of the
methods under test) to k expr, given the type mapping
provided by the formal params of the method under test.

Problem: 
The method under test takes an argument which is of type "SingleVariableDeclaration",
which cannot be instantiated by clients; as a result, to make the test easier,
we can either extract an obj of SingleVariableDeclaration via traversing the compilation
unit; or, refactored the original method so that it takes hash map as args which are 
easier to build from scratch.

Considering the fact that building hashmap from string of java expr also requries work.
The first approach is adopted.

The param str 's' is used to gen a simple class whose only method's formal param list is
's'. Then the class string is parsed into compilation unit, which can be traversed and
retrieve the list of SingleVariableDeclaration (the method param list).
