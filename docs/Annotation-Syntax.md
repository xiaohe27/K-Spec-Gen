##Overall annotation description
The annotations used in the project borrowed a subset of syntax from [JML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Modeling_Language),
and also incorporated some newly-defined syntax, so that the users are able to specify normal method contracts (pre/post conditions,
return values, and loop invariants).
