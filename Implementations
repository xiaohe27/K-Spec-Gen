For the function that converts a java expression (user's annotations that represent pre/post conditions), there are two approaches.

1) Transform the AST tree
advant: easy to do the transformation, no need to worry that transformation of one symbol affects others.
e.g. from < to <Int 
and <= to <=Int may interfere one another if we transform via String's replacing method.

disadvant:
the output may have some unnecessary brackets;
need some efforts to create the AST tree for the output structure.

2) pattern matching and replacing
advantage: no extra brackets; no need to build AST
disadvant: see the advant part of the previous approach.
